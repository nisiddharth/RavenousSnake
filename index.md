<h3>Make Harry the Snake üêç eat the Apple Pie!!</h3>
<br>
A beautiful snake game, with rich graphics and audio feedbacks.
<br>
<br>
This project is made using Java swing in NetBeans 11.0.
<br>
<br>
Find the executable JAR file (binary) in 'dist' folder or just download [from here](https://github.com/nisiddharth/RavenousSnake/raw/master/dist/Snake2D.jar).
<br>
<br>
There is also a batch file provided in the ['dist'](https://github.com/nisiddharth/RavenousSnake/raw/master/dist) folder (run_in_windows.bat) to help run the game by just double clicking on the batch file (only applicable to Windows).
<br>
<br>
<h3>Rules </h3>
<br>
You know it all, just don't crash with Harry's body, feed to grow him larger and beat the highscore.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Known bug: </h3>
Sometimes Harry stops for a second while eating the apple pie. (Probably happens due to loading of the audio file).
<br>
All suggestions are welcome!
